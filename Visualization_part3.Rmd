## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
data=read_xlsx("D:/Githubfordatamining/FA24-DATS6101-11/Project1/EDA_Global_Terrorism/Global_terrorism_data_cleaned_01.xlsx")

# Data Wrangling: Summarize the count of attacks per month for each attack type
attack_data <- data %>%
  group_by(AttackType, Month) %>%
  summarise(attack_count = n())

# Plotting the heatmap
ggplot(attack_data, aes(x = Month, y = AttackType, fill = attack_count)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Seasonality of Terrorist Attacks", 
       x = "Month", 
       y = "Attack Type", 
       fill = "Attack Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
  )

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
